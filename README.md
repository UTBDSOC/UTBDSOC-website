# 🐅 UTSBDSOC Official Website (Open Source)

Welcome to the official repository of the **UTS Bangladeshi Society (UTSBDSOC)** website — a student-led project built by and for the Bangladeshi community at the University of Technology Sydney.

This project aims to **document**, **preserve**, and **celebrate** our society’s culture, events, and community spirit in a modern, accessible, and mobile-friendly format. It is **open-source** to encourage future committee members and student developers to learn, iterate, and maintain the site with ease.
